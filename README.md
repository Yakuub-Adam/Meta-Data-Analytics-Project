# Meta-Data-Analytics-Project

## Project Overview
This project involved analysing Instagram ad performance for a sportswear brand to determine which ad format was most effective in driving engagement, website traffic, and sales. The analysis focused on three ad types: static image, athlete + product image, and video of athlete + product.

The goal was to provide data-driven recommendations to optimise campaign effectiveness and cost-efficiency.

## Dataset
- The dataset contains 1,000+ entries with user interaction metrics.
- Key metrics analysed:
  - **CTR (Click Through Rate):** measures how often users clicked the ad.
  - **ER (Engagement Rate):** measures overall interaction with the ad.
  - **CVR (Conversion Rate):** measures the rate of purchases after seeing the ad.

## Analysis
- The data was analysed in **Google Colab (Python)**.
- Comparative analysis was conducted to evaluate each ad format across the key metrics.
- Visualisations and summary tables were created to highlight differences in performance.

## Key Findings
- **Video ad (athlete + product)** achieved the highest engagement rate (**29.2% ER**) and conversion rate (**4.9% CVR**), making it most effective for driving interactions and purchases.
- **Static ads** achieved the highest click-through rate (**23.3% CTR**), making them cost-effective for generating website traffic.
- While some ad formats underperformed overall, they may still be valuable in targeted retargeting campaigns due to lower costs.

## Outcome
- Recommendations were presented in a concise PowerPoint presentation.
- Data-driven insights supported the decision to prioritise the video ad format for the main campaign, optimising both engagement and sales.
